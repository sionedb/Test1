##  Example project to create a Random Number Generator

Example of java coding projects used for improving coding and interview skills


Implement in java a random generator which can be initialised by
a set of Random Numbers e.g. [-1, 0, 100, 300] and Probabilities e.g. [0.01, 0.4, 0.55, 0.04] 
in such a way that when generator called
repeatedly we get results according
to the distribution of probablities.
E.g.  if with above initialisation a generator were called 100 times we may get the following results: 
<li>-1: 1 times 
<li>0: 36 times 
<li>100: 57 times 
<li>300: 6 times 
As the results are random, these particular results are unlikely to be repeated.

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

This project exists to give experience with git and github, ecilpse and maven

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.
